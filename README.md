# Sertum

One window for every coding agent you have running.

A desktop GUI that manages multiple AI coding agents — Claude Code and Codex —
across separate working folders and git worktrees, with a live embedded
terminal per session and status you can trust at a glance.

Design source of truth: `SertumDesigns.pen`, tracked at the repo root and
opened with pen.dev. The wireframe ids in code comments (`B3`, `C1`, …) are
frame ids in that file.

## Architecture: two planes

The single decision everything else follows from. These never do each other's
job:

| Plane | Owns | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — pixels** | Characters in, characters out | `node-pty` per session, rendered by `@xterm/xterm`. Never parsed for meaning. |
| **2 — truth** | What each agent is actually doing | Adapter events. Claude Code hooks and Codex app-server JSON-RPC: **both done**. |

A tab badge turns amber because the agent *said* it needs input — not because
its pixels stopped moving.

## Status

What's built and verified so far:

- [x] Electron 44 + Vite + TypeScript, strict mode clean
- [x] `node-pty` rebuilt against Electron's ABI; PTY spawn / write / read / resize / kill
- [x] Real agent TUIs render correctly (Claude Code and Codex draw their
      full-screen UI, on macOS and Windows)
- [x] Keystrokes reach the PTY from the renderer
- [x] Tab strip, sidebar grouped by status, pane header, status bar
- [x] New Session dialog (wireframe C1) with a **native folder picker**, live
      git validation, recent folders, and auto-derived tab labels
- [x] **Plane 2 for Claude Code** — loopback hook endpoint, per-session binding,
      status and activity driven by real agent events
- [x] **Plane 2 for Codex** — a private app-server instance per app run,
      driven over JSON-RPC (`thread/status/changed`, mapped by
      `mapCodexStatus`); the TUI still renders for real while status arrives
      out-of-band
- [x] **Adopting sessions started elsewhere** — discovery, transcript
      summaries, and raising the owning OS window
- [x] **Worktree management** (wireframe C9) — inventory of what exists on
      disk and what it costs, creation handed off to C1's isolation preset,
      safe removal
- [x] **Agent binary resolution you can see and override** — Settings >
      Agents shows each agent's resolved path, a Detect button re-runs
      discovery, Browse... sets a manual override; the status bar calls out a
      binary that can't be found at all
- [ ] Diff review (wireframe C11)
- [ ] The rest of Settings (E2–E7) — worktree bootstrap config (E4) and others
      beyond today's display/agent panes
- [ ] Split views (wireframes G1–G8)

## How status actually works

Each Claude session is spawned with `--settings` carrying a hooks blob whose
URLs point at *that session's own* endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port>/hook/<session-uuid>
```

So an arriving event is attributable to exactly one pane with no correlation
guesswork.

The hooks are `command` hooks running a one-line `curl` POST. The endpoint was
originally built for the `http` hook type, which reads better, but as of Claude
Code 2.1.247 an `http` hook is accepted in settings and then never fires --
registering both types on one event shows only the command arriving. That
failure is silent and total: the settings are accepted and the endpoint is
live, so plane 2 looks wired while no status ever moves. curl keeps the
cross-platform property the http type was chosen for, shipping with macOS,
mainstream Linux, and Windows 10 and later.

Observed transitions for one real turn (`uname -a`), all hook-driven:

| Event | Status | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| `Notification` (idle_prompt) | `needs-input` | Claude is waiting for your input |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working` | thinking |
| `PreToolUse` | `working` | Bash… |
| `PostToolUse` | `working` | Bash |
| `Stop` | `idle` | turn finished |

The dot moves because the agent said so — never because output went quiet.
Late events for an exited process are ignored, so a dead session's dot cannot
be resurrected.

## Adopting sessions started outside the app

A PTY's master file descriptor belongs to whoever spawned it. A session started
in iTerm2 therefore **cannot** have its terminal rendered here — no OS offers a
way to take that over. This is why tmux exists, and it is a constraint rather
than a missing feature.

What is possible splits in two, and the UI says which you are getting:

| Session | Listed | Summary | Status | Terminal here | Raise its window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude --bg` (daemon-hosted) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ `claude attach` | n/a |
| Interactive claude in another terminal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ polled | ✗ | ✓ |
| Codex in another terminal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ polled | ✗ | ✓ |
| Started inside tmux | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (planned) | ✓ |

Clicking a monitored row raises the exact terminal tab that owns it. On macOS
the tab is matched by controlling tty, so a window with ten tabs still lands on
the right one; other platforms fall back to activating the app, and unsupported
ones say so instead of failing quietly.

Discovery is agent-agnostic by construction. `AgentDiscoverer` implementations
are tried richest-first and merged by pid:

- **claude** — `claude agents --json` gives session id, name and live status
- **process scan** — walks the process table for any known agent binary, so
  Codex works today with no vendor API; adding an agent is one row in
  `AGENT_COMMANDS`

Summaries come from each agent's own transcript, which is on disk regardless of
who owns the process — `~/.claude/projects/**/<id>.jsonl` and
`~/.codex/sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl`. Only the tail is read.

Codex's own app-server already drives live status for sessions Sertum starts
(Plane 2, above), but that connection doesn't yet reach backward to describe
sessions started elsewhere — which is why process-scan remains the only Codex
discoverer today. Teaching discovery to query the app server directly would
make it a richer discoverer registered ahead of the process scan; nothing
downstream changes when that lands.

## Running

```sh
npm start                                  # dev
SERTUM_DEBUG_PORT=9222 npm start     # dev + remote debugging
```

Main-process changes require a full restart; Vite only hot-reloads the renderer.

## Verification

Screen capture is unavailable in some environments, so the app can be checked
headlessly.

```sh
# PTY layer only — no UI. Also the cross-platform check for Windows/Linux.
npx electron scripts/smoke-pty.js          # default shell
npx electron scripts/smoke-pty.js claude   # a real agent TUI

# Drive the running app (needs SERTUM_DEBUG_PORT)
node scripts/drive.js "document.querySelectorAll('.tab').length"
```

`window.__sertum` is exposed in dev builds only. It is the app object itself:
`panes.get(activeId).snapshot()` returns the focused terminal's scrollback,
which is the only way to read terminal contents while the WebGL renderer is
active.

## Windows notes

Development so far has mostly happened on macOS. Running on Windows 11
surfaced a handful of differences, some already handled in code and some
fixed along the way:

- **Forge's rebuild step wants a full native toolchain it doesn't need.**
  `node-pty` ships its own prebuilt N-API binaries per platform/arch
  (`node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/win32-x64/…`), and N-API is ABI-stable
  across Node/Electron — no rebuild is actually required. Left alone, Forge's
  `rebuildConfig` doesn't know that and falls through to `node-gyp rebuild`,
  which wants MSVC Build Tools. Fixed by `ignoreModules: ['node-pty']` in
  `forge.config.ts`.
- **npm 11's `allowScripts` blocks install scripts by default.** `node-pty`
  (fetches its prebuild), `esbuild`, and `electron-winstaller` (the Squirrel
  installer maker, Windows-only) all need their `postinstall`/`install`
  scripts to run. Without an `allowScripts` block in `package.json`, `npm
  install` silently skips them and `node-pty` ends up with no native binary
  at all.
- **Codex sessions failed to start — `resolveCodexBinary()` had no Windows
  branch.** Its candidate list was entirely POSIX paths (`~/.codex/…`,
  `/opt/homebrew/…`, `/usr/local/…`), so on win32 it always fell through to
  a bare `'codex'` and let PATH decide. That's the right call on macOS/Linux,
  but wrong on Windows for two independent reasons, both hit here:
  - `codex` is installed by npm as a `codex.cmd` shim (confirmed via `where
    codex`), never as `codex.exe`. `node-pty`'s Windows backend calls
    `CreateProcess` directly, which resolves a bare name by trying
    `<name>.exe` only — it doesn't walk `PATHEXT` the way a shell does. A
    session pane spawning `codex` failed with `Cannot create process, error
    code: 2` (`ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`), reproduced directly with
    `npx electron scripts/smoke-pty.js codex`.
  - Separately, the app's own Codex app-server (`spawn(this.binary, …)` in
    `codex-app-server.ts`) uses plain `child_process.spawn`, and Node has
    refused to spawn `.cmd`/`.bat` files without `shell: true` since the
    CVE-2024-27980 hardening — it throws `EINVAL` *synchronously*, not via
    the `'error'` event the code already handles gracefully.
  - Fixed by adding a win32 branch to `resolveCodexBinary()` that walks
    `PATH` × `PATHEXT` itself (mirroring what a shell would do, since neither
    `CreateProcess` nor `child_process.spawn` will), and by setting `shell:
    true` on the app-server spawn when the resolved binary is a `.cmd`/
    `.bat`. Verified end-to-end: a real codex session now spawns, connects
    to the app server, and reaches `status: "working"`.
- **`ClaudeAdapter.resolveBinary()` on win32 hardcoded the literal string
  `'claude.exe'`, with no existence check at all.** The installed `claude` is
  a genuine `claude.exe`, not an npm shim, so `CreateProcess`'s built-in
  "append `.exe` to a bare name" does find it when it exists — but
  `resolveBinary()` never actually checked, unlike the real PATH × PATHEXT
  search Codex had. A session spawned `'claude.exe'` regardless of whether
  that resolved to anything, so a broken or absent install failed exactly
  like the Codex case above, and just as silently. Fixed by giving
  `ClaudeAdapter.resolveBinary()` the same candidate-list-then-PATH search as
  Codex, factored into a shared `src/main/adapters/binary-resolve.ts` both
  adapters now call.
- **Every session-creation failure was swallowed as an unhandled renderer
  rejection, on every platform, for every agent** — so any spawn failure,
  including the `claude.exe` bug above, looked identical to "click the button,
  nothing happens." `new-session-dialog.ts` now performs session creation
  itself and reports a failure inline instead of closing and letting the
  error vanish. Settings > Agents (Detect / Browse... / a manual per-agent
  path override) and a status-bar "Claude Code not found" / "Codex not
  found" readout make a missing binary diagnosable rather than mysterious.
- **`npm start` in dev mode shows Electron's own icon, not Sertum's.**
  `npm start` runs the bare `electron.exe`/`Electron.app` binary, which
  carries Electron's generic icon; a packaged build is its own icon-bearing
  executable (`packagerConfig.icon`, applied by resedit at package time) and
  needs no override. On macOS this was already patched for dev via
  `dev-app-name.js`, but nothing did the equivalent for the title bar and
  taskbar on Windows. Fixed by passing an explicit `icon:` to `BrowserWindow`
  whenever `MAIN_WINDOW_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` is set (i.e., only in dev).
- **`node-pty`'s ConPTY `kill()` can throw a benign but scary-looking
  uncaught exception.** On the non-DLL ConPTY path, `kill()` forks a helper
  (`conpty_console_list_agent.js`) to enumerate and force-kill the shell's
  descendant processes, working around orphaned children (upstream cites
  microsoft/vscode#26807). That helper calls `AttachConsole` on the just-killed
  process's console and can lose the race, throwing `Error: AttachConsole
  failed` with a full stack trace to stderr *after* the PTY has already been
  killed successfully. Harmless — it's a one-shot child process, not the app
  — but there's no macOS equivalent (the POSIX backend is a plain
  `forkpty`), so don't mistake it for a real failure when it shows up in the
  logs.
- **The login-shell environment probe is a deliberate no-op on Windows.**
  `hydrateLoginEnv()` exists because a macOS GUI app launched from the Dock
  inherits launchd's near-empty PATH, not the user's shell profile — fixed by
  asking `$SHELL -lic env` once at startup. `process.platform === 'win32'`
  short-circuits that entirely and always returns `false`, which is correct:
  Windows doesn't have the launchd problem, since Explorer-launched processes
  already inherit the full user/system PATH from the registry. The startup
  log line — `using the inherited environment; login shell did not answer` —
  reads like a failure on Windows but is actually "as designed, never
  attempted."
- **Closing the window quits the whole app, unlike macOS.**
  `window-all-closed` already guards on `process.platform !== 'darwin'`, so
  this is handled correctly, not a bug — but it's a real behavior difference
  worth knowing if you're used to Sertum staying alive in the Dock after the
  last window closes. On Windows (and Linux), closing the window ends the
  process, the hook server, and every session it owns.
- `dev-app-name.js` (the Dock name/icon branding hack) already no-ops on
  `process.platform !== 'darwin'`, `titleBarStyle` already falls back to
  `'default'` off Darwin, and `curl`-based hooks and the PTY smoke test
  already worked as documented above with no changes needed.
